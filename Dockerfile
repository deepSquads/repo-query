# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# This dockerfile is a rust binary builder for the repo-query engine.
#
# Note: running "cargo build" will also fetch the onnx runtime ".so" file into
# cargo's target/release directory which is needed to start the server.

# This also includes libssl dependencies which are required by reqwest within
# the cargo dependency tree which uses "native-tls"
# TODO (jpmcb): It may be advantageous for us to explore replacing native-tls
# deep in the dependencies with rustls to avoid some of the nasty openssl
# remote code execution vulnerabilities.
#
# Uses the bullseye-slim debian image per the rust recommendation.
