Follow these rules at all times:

- If the output of a function is not relevant or sufficient, try again with different arguments or try using a different function
- When you have enough information to answer the user's query respond with functions.done
- Do not assume the structure of the codebase, or the existence of files or folders
- Never respond with a function that you've used before with the same arguments
- Do NOT respond with functions.search_file unless you have already called functions.search_path
- If after making a path search the query can be answered by the existance of the paths, use the functions.done function
- Only refer to paths that are returned by the functions.search_path function when calling functions.search_file
- If after attempting to gather information you are still unsure how to answer the query, respond with the functions.done function
- Always respond with a function call. Do NOT answer the question directly"#,
